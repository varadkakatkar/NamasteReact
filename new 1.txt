React is not JSX

it can be written without jsx
JSX is not HTML inside jsx, it is HTML like syntax or XML like syntax

jsx is just syntax , react element is an object 

// Babel is a toolchain(javascript compiler) that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in various environments.


React component 

everthing in react is component 

1) Class based components
2) Functional components => react function that returns a jsx 


component composition => component inside a component 

 


Injection attack => corss side scriptng attack
data is sanitizing by jsx 


config driven UI

React hook (normal js function)
useState=> 

whenever a state varable updates, react re-renders   the component
useEffect 



Reconciliation Algorithm (React fiber)




Actual DOM is tag 
<div>
	<div>
	
	</div>
</div>


virtual DOM => representation of actual DOM( react elemennt object ) ( chapter 5)

Incremental rendering ( efficient dom maunipulation ) 



CHAPTER 6 
monolith and microservice architecture 


monolith 

API , UI code , auth, db connetivity , sending notification 
everthing inside same projects 
microservice =>

differnet service for different job
combining together and creat a big app 
(separation of concerns , single responsibility ) 

two approaches to fetch data 

1)as soon as page loads and after getting data render UI
2)as soon as page loads quickly render UI then make API and after getting data once again ( better approach and better user experience ) 

Render cycle are very fast ( 2 renders , instead of keep user waiting , showhim at least a skeleton and after getting data again render UI ) 


useEffect hook => to do something after rendering function  / called after component renderd , call callback function 






If origin mismatch then browser blocks access local to swiggey server( CORS video) 

shimmmer UI 

why to use useState

on change of local state component , react re-renders a component ( on change in search box)

state variable updates => rerenders component

 Routing configuration
 
 createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet, Link,useRouteError
 
 Client side routing
 
 server side routing => make a network call and fetches the call renders page
 
 
 SPA => client side routing 
 
 GraphQL => loads only data which is requeired in application
